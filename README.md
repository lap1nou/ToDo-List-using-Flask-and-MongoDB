	$ sudo service mongod start
2) Stop MongoDB
	$ sudo service mongod stop

Run the Flask file(app.py)
	$ python app.py

Go to http://localhost:5000 with any of browsers and DONE !!
	$ open http://localhost:5000

## Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose)

Make sure that you are inside the project directory, where `docker-compose.yaml` file is present. Now, building and running the application server container and mongodb container using `docker-compose` :
```
Building or fetching the necessary images and later, creating and starting containers for the application
    $ docker-compose up

Go to http://localhost:5000 with any of browsers and DONE !!
    $ open http://localhost:5000
```

### Running, Debugging and Stopping the application under the hood
```
For almost all of the `docker-compose` commands, make sure that you are inside the project directory, where `docker-compose.yaml` file is present.

Passing `-d` flag along with docker-compose, runs the application as daemon
    $ docker-compose up -d

Seeing all of the logs from the application deployed.
    $ docker-compose logs

Stopping the application
    $ docker-compose down
```
